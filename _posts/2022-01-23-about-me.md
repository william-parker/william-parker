## A little info on my life

My name is William Parker, but most people call me Will and I use He/Him pronouns. I am a senior majoring in computer science. My hometown is a little one-horse town on the Chesapeake Bay called White Stone.

CNU isn’t the first university that I have attended. During my freshman year, I was a cadet in the Virginia Tech Corps of Cadets. I had a rough time at such a large school with class sizes larger than my entire high school. Since I transferred, I have felt much more comfortable and confident.

Taking ENGL 350 honestly wasn’t my first choice, but I didn’t get to register for classes until final add/drop because of some medical issues I had last semester. That being said, I am excited to be taking the opportunity to learn about digital humanities.

I have participated in independent research since high school—when I studied marsh sediments. More recently, I have been working on network security. My interests are extremely varied, and I think understanding digital humanities will help me to understand some of the different ways I can combine my interests.

I will not be attending graduate school even though I have already been accepted. Instead, I plan on starting my career and returning to school later to make sure my degree is more relevant to my future goals. I am burnt out from the last sixteen years of school, and I want to get out of my current debt before I take on more.

Once I am out of school, I plan on becoming a software engineer. I think it’s an extremely varied field that can offer a lot of flexibility and that is what I am looking for in a career. It is much easier to live a happy and fulfilling life when your life isn’t your job.

Currently, when I am not in class or doing homework, I am very active in my fraternity—Delta Upsilon. As the Vice President of Brotherhood, it is my job to plan events that my brothers will enjoy and promote our founding principles. One cool fact about DU is that it was founded to be non-secret. What that means is that we have open chapter meetings and rituals. In fact, the ritual book is [a PDF](https://cdn.zephyrcms.com/a53b866d-fd12-43e0-83a3-7c29a4f78f7a/-/inline/yes/cornerstone-2021-for-website.pdf) on the DU website.

The last thing I want to touch on is my favorite quote: 
…quote…
It belongs to Teddy Roosevelt, and it is from a larger speech called Citizenship in a Republic, given to the French public on _date_. I find this excerpt to be extremely motivational. As cliché as it is, I think there is nothing wrong with daring greatly.
