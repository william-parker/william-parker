With the semester coming to a close, it is time for me to reflect on my classes and what they did for me. I think ENGL 350 was probably my hardest class this semester, and not because the work was hard, but because I am not entirely comfortable with non-technical writing.

I knew going into this course that I would I have to write a lot, but I expected it to be more focused on the blogs based on the course description. That is a large part of the reason I chose this class&#150;I hate long-form and creative writing. I don’t hate reading it, I am just not a writer myself.

As a STEM major, most of the writing assignments I encounter are extremely technical and require very little creativity. That was different in this class. Finally, I had to write for the humanities, and it was a steep learning curve. The Grant Project really pushed me to my limits because of this. 

I have previously received the Independent Research Grant to do some computer science research, but that was extremely different to what I had to do in this project. On top of that, I had never written and annotated bibliography, so that is a skill that I have picked up from this class.

I don’t think we went over many technical aspects of writing except how to write for the internet. The readings on internet writing helped prepare me for the blog posts. It has made me much more aware of what I am reading and how it is formatted on the internet.

Coming into this semester, I had never heard of Digital Humanities. I am thankful that I got to explore the field because there are so many cool projects coming out. Being able to describe DH and learning to think like a Digital Humanist were my biggest take-aways from this class. I catch myself considering project ideas while doing research for other classes or just browsing the internet. 

I learned that DH covers a broad category of research projects and websites. Almost anything that combines technology with a subject from the humanities can be considered DH. That doesn’t mean that any humanities project that is digital is DH. Usually there is some kind of interactive element for the user.

The very first assignment that we had was the “About Me” blog post. Learning how to use GitHub pages will benefit me later on when I make a personal website for potential employers. On top of that, learning to markup text helps to learn how read already marked up text.

My favorite project from this class was the _Dracula’s Guest_ transcription. Although I had never used XML specifically before, I do have experience with HTML. The transition is easy to make since they are so similar. I did rush through that project and made a couple of careless mistakes, but I had fun with it.

During the Review Blog portion of the class, I really enjoyed looking through all the projects. I struggled a little with my review because I chose a more complicated project (you can read my review [here]{https://william-parker.github.io/william-parker/2022/02/06/review-blog.html}). However, I chose the project because it was so complex, and the idea was cool. It forced me to get creative and provided a challenge.

A lot of what we worked on this semester was being concise in our writing. I have never been accused of not being concise enough. In fact, many times I struggle to meet minimum word counts because I am too concise. This class has helped me to find that sweet spot between providing too few details and too many.

I wasn’t a fan of the Twitter posts. I understand their relevance and how important it is to be able to communicate through a variety of digital platforms and formats, however I am not a fan of tweeting or posting on social networks in general. I am not that privacy focused; I just don’t like the coldness that is promoted by the formats.

Overall, my writing has improved, even if I just had a different person grading my papers. But I think my writing has technically improved over the course of this semester. I feel better prepared to write for any digital or non-digital format in the future.
