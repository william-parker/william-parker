_Six Degrees of Francis Bacon_ (SDFB) is a project based on the 1994 game _Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon_. The game derives its name from the simple rule—any famous person is only a maximum of six degrees of separation from Kevin Bacon. A chain of co-stars and guest appearances can be put together to find the “Bacon Number”—the number of steps to reach Kevin Bacon. The rules have been modified through the years with the core concept remaining the same. 

The main goal of SDFB is to visualize and compile historic relationships centered around Francis Bacon, the sixteenth and seventeenth century English philosopher and politician. Anyone with historical data on any individual can contribute to the website, whether it is a new person or a new connection between people. Behind the scenes there is an algorithm that will infer connections. These inferred connections are displayed slightly differently, but there could be more distinction in the confidence levels. 

When the website first loads, every first- and second-degree relationship to Francis Bacon is displayed. Each person is represented by a labeled circle with lines denoting connections between individuals. These circles can be clicked to focus on the connections of a specific individual. Almost unnoticeable on the left side of the screen, under the birth and death dates, are links to Oxford DNB, JSTOR, and Google searches. On the bottom of the screen, the groups that the individual belonged to are also highlighted. The lines can be selected to focus on a relationship between two people. There are also options to view groups and societies to which the historic figures belonged.

The **HELP** tab at the top of the page shows how to use the website because it can be quite unintuitive to navigate through the relationships and varying views offered. Although it opens a new window when clicked, closing the help tab brings you back to the home screen in the same window. It is almost guaranteed that you will have multiple windows open that are displaying the same information. Each window is extremely resource intense and will slow down and diminish the overall experience. Even loading the page the first time can take a couple of minutes. Once the page loads, it can take several seconds for a click to register and the site to load a new view. It seems like there could be some additional optimization that can be done on the backend to improve the responsiveness.

To the left is a **BROWSE** button that takes you to an alphabetical list of all the people. Here, you can view the references for their relationship, their historical significance, and personal details. There is also a button to visualize each person’s network next to their names. At the top of the page is a **DOWNLOAD ALL PEOPLE** button. However, it downloads a CSV of the page’s HTML code and not an actual list of the people.

Overall, the project achieves its goal of visualizing relationships. Just reading about these connections, it is hard to understand who would have known whom and how. It is a literal social network centered around Francis Bacon.

When I tried to load SDFB on my smartphone, instead of loading the page and displaying a smaller, less intense network, it instead shows a message to use a different device. However, I did not run into the same issue on my iPad. 

Overall, Six Degrees of Francis Bacon is an excellent example of how modern technology and crowd sourcing can help to better understand the past. As the network grows, it helps to put personal relationships into context. Personally, I would love to see this project continue and more people join the team to deliver an even better experience to the user.
